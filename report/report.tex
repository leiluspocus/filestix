Introduction
The purpose of this homework was to develop a bluetooth application running on Gumstix Boards. I decided to develop a file sharing application to facilitate the sending of files between two gumstix boards.
My main objective for this application was to develop a user-friendly interface: I wanted to develop a tool easy to use, so that the user could avoid using a terminal.
